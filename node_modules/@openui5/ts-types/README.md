# @openui5/ts-types

This npm package contains the types signatures (based on deprecated globals, see below) for all the OpenUI5 libraries.

<b>NOTE:</b> "based on globals" means that it supports the usage of the global "sap" object and the huge tree below this global object containing all modules and controls. But this usage is <b>no longer recommended</b>. In traditional JavaScript, UI5 application code should use the asynchronous `sap.ui.define()`/`sap.ui.require()` calls instead and for TypeScript code we recommend using ES6 module syntax provided by the [@openui5/types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openui5/types) package. So better use that one instead of this package.

The central entry point for all information about using UI5 with TypeScript (incl. sample apps and templates) is at https://ui5.github.io/typescript.

## Status

This project **deprecated**. Please use [@openui5/types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openui5/types) instead.
